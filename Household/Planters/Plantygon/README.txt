# Summary

Plantygon is a modular geometric stacking planter. Designed to accommodate my growing collection of succulents, it is based on the truncated octohedron which can tesselate in 3D space. This allows each planter to stack together in any combination that you’d like! 

Each planter has a sloped inner drain leading to holes which drain into the neighboring planters. A version without drainage holes is also available for indoor use.
4/16/18 Update: Added version with single side of drainage holes, and opposing sides drainage holes!

Printed planters available on Etsy: https://www.etsy.com/shop/PrintFutura

Print more to build your garden as your succulents propagate, or collect many varieties of tiny plants!

Designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 on macbook, and printed on Ultimaker 2+ at 0.15 mm layer height.

Supports optional depending on your printer’s bridging ability, I print in Cura with supports set to ‘Touching Buildplate’.

## Printability notes

Notes on having consistently good Plantygon prints:
-These are particularly sensitive to filament quality, I've had the best results with eSun and ProtoPasta. PLA blends with less warping tend to print better. If you're having issues with the arms check temperature, retraction, or z-hop settings.

-Much like the design itself, these tend to work better printed in multiples. Printing 2 or more at once helps with the nozzle approach angle & layer cooling on the top half to reduce collision with the thin arms.
