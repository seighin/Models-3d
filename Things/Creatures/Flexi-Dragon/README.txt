# Summary

I really liked the style of the dragon done here https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:570345 by muzz64 and thought I would try my hand at making it flexi with both wings attaching with only pressure. The wings attached for me great and are very hard to take back out. I'm sure results will vary dependent on how well printers are setup.(I have some elephant foot on my prints which may be helping the fit). Try one wing and if it is too loose try printing at 101%.

Update: Rev B
Changes
-  Improved the clips to attach the wings, They will be a little harder to get in but should be very hard to take out.(RevB not compatible with the first Dragon)I have not been able to remove the wings with out breaking something.
-  Improved the arch of the neck, his head should not point down as much. This may differ from printer to printer.
-  Increased the size of the hinges on the wings. This should make them more robust.
