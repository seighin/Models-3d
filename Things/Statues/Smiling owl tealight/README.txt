# Summary

UPDATE: I have added a version of this owl without the small holes.


I loved the original design created by BS3 but wanted to change a few things.
   - First I rotated the wing and meshed it back.
   - Then I added all the small holes so the LED tea light would shine better.

# Print Settings

Printer: Da vinci 3in1 Pro
Resolution: 0.15 mm
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
Material:
ABS natural
PLA brown

# How I Designed This

## Directions for use:

The owl simply sits overtop of the tea light.

Recommend using LED tea lights, but any battery operated tea light will work. 

It has not been tested with real tea lights and I do not recommend them for this design size. 

## Design Programs:

Meshmixer
Tinkercad
3D Builder

## Final images coming

It is currently printing so as soon as it finished I will upload pictures of it lit and unlit.
