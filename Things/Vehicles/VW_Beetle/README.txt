# Summary

I couldn't find the exact Beetle I wanted on Thingiverse, so I found this one at 3D Warehouse here: https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/feebf897c0e81cf5cafc079b5aa12ef7/VW-Bug
After many, many hours of fiddling, I found out it had holes and stray edges, so I downloaded SketchUp as well as the extensions SketchUp STL and Solid Inspector^2 and fixed those up. For some reason one of the door handles was removed and the wheels weren't attatched on Beetle.stl so I took it into Autodesk Inventor and fixed those and titled it Basic Beetle, but the STL was acting kinda janky and didn't let me reconvert back to a solid so I included both files.
